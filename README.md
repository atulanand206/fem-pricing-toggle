## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard
- **Bonus**: Complete the challenge with just HTML and CSS

## My process

- Used containers for structuring the categories.
- Used same classes on similar elements.
- Additional classes to change certain behaviour of similar but not same elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Pseudo elements for creating top and bottom borders.
- Hover transition for making the buttons look real.
- Use of flex containers on many levels of hierarchy.
- Gradient to be used as color of element.

### Continued development

- CSS Tricks to do things inherently instead of JS overrides.
